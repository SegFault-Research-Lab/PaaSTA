Feature: cleanup_chronos_jobs removes chronos jobs no longer in the config

 Scenario: Cleanup chronos jobs removes jobs
   Given a working paasta cluster
     And I have yelpsoa-configs for the service "myservice" with disabled chronos instance "UNUSED"
    When I launch 3 configured jobs for the service "myservice" with chronos instance "UNUSED" and differing tags
     And I launch 1 unconfigured jobs for the service "oldservice" with chronos instance "foo" and differing tags
     And I launch 3 non-paasta jobs
    Then cleanup_chronos_jobs exits with return code "0" and the correct output
     And the non chronos jobs are still in the job list
     And the configured chronos jobs are in the job list
     And the unconfigured chronos jobs are not in the job list
